# Sandbox
Sandbox for optimizing and experimenting

Currently being used to update and improve my first project I made.

Changes from original:

Added custom error messages if the city is not found.

Removed comment sections as it did not fit with the overall project.

Added air pollution level area in place of comment section. Also added the pollution report to reflect the current city.
